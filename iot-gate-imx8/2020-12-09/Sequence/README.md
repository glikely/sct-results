# SCT_Parser
---
This is an external Parser script for UEFI SCT. (WIP)

It's designed to read a `.ekl` results log from an UEFI SCT run, and a generated `.seq` from UEFI SCT configurator.

It will proceed to generate a Markdown file listing number of failures, passes, each test from the sequence file set that was Silently dropped, and a list of all failures and warnings.


## Usage
Usage to generate a "result md" is such. `python3 parser.py <log_file.ekl> <seq_file.seq>` 
If you do no provided any command line arguments it will use `sample.ekl` and `sample.seq`.


### Custom search (WIP)
For a custom Key:value search, the next two arguments *MUST be included together.* The program will search and display files that met that constraint, without the crosscheck, and display the names, guid, and key:value to the command line. `python3 Parser.py <file.ekl> <file.seq> <search key> <search value>`

you can use the `test_dict` below to see available keys. 







## Notes
### Known Issues:
* "comment" is currently not implemented, as formatting is not currently consistent, should reflect the comments from the test.
* some SCT tests have shared GUIDs,
* some lines in ekl file follow Different naming Conventions
* some tests in the sequence file are not strongly Associated with the test spec. 


### TODO:
* double check concatenation of all `.ekl` logs, preliminary tests show small Divergence between them and `summary.ekl` found in `Overall` folder. Cat.sh will generate this file.
* look into large number of dropped tests.


### db structure:
```
